      <p class="c8"><span class="c2">LET&rsquo;S DANCE AND SHARE LOVE AND JOY!!!&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c2">TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE THIS AN AMAZING UNFORGETTABLE EVENT!!!</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c1">LIMBO is a creative research collaboration between queer refugee community organizers/artists, Framer Framed and Refugee Academy (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam).&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c1">In LIMBO, we co-create knowledge on how academic research can be mutually beneficial in terms of knowledge and resources for those involved. We focus on queer refugees&rsquo; talents and creativity by creating inclusive spaces to develop together as a community. This is important because Dutch institutions and individuals oftentimes have good intentions but mainly perceive refugees as victims and focus on what they lack. They may try to help refugees improve in order to fit into mainstream society, but often fail to recognize what refugees have to offer in terms of creativity, strength, resilience, unique talents, community building and so on. A constant focus on what someone cannot do, and the expectation that someone should adapt to Dutch cultural norms, creates frustration, insecurity and feelings of not belonging or not being good enough.</span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c1">Actual inclusion should start with embracing one&rsquo;s unique perspectives, background and skills and focus on what this community has to offer as opposed to what they lack. At the same time, there should be space to listen to challenges refugees face, and find solutions together. </span><span class="c9">Nothing about us without us!</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This is important because the Dutch self image is one of being liberal, open minded and advanced in terms of women&rsquo;s and gay emancipation. This national self image creates blind spots when it comes to exclusion or discrimination. Think for instance about the Black Pete discussion or institutional racism within the </span><span class="c9">Belastingdienst</span><span class="c1">. Queer people, particularly of color, refugees and migrants can uncover such blind spots by referring to their lived experiences. However, pointing out exclusion and (institutional) racism can be unsafe, because it can trigger (sometimes extremely) defensive reactions: </span><span class="c9">&ldquo;We are trying to help! You should be grateful! If you don&#39;t like it here, go back where you came from!&rdquo;</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c1">For these reasons (and more) we facilitate creative workshops in the art institution Framer Framed given </span><span class="c9">by</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c9">for</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;folx from the queer refugee community. We focus on a safer environment to share reflections in many forms and languages: spoken, written, drawn, sewn, sang or danced to name a few. If you want to read more, Alaa and Fabian, two members of the larger organizing team, wrote about being </span><span class="c14"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://engagedscholarshipnarrativesofchange.org/images/pdf/LIMBO_Pages_from_41-016_FM62_LR_SP_ALL.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1673905436224061&amp;usg=AOvVaw0LFU_OYNIdi4bAprq01hfN">Safe Enough To Be Brave</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;here.</span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c2">LIMBO - queer safer celebration</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is an example of shifting the focus from &lsquo;helping refugees&rsquo; to recognizing the power, creativity and joy of our community and allies. For this celebration we collaborate with [</span><span class="c9">location will be announced on January 20</span><span class="c1">] and are very happy and grateful to share our energy and love with a bigger circle of friends and allies!</span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c21">What is a queer safer celebration?</span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c1">We </span><span class="c2">celebrate</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;our one-year anniversary and all the things we have done so far. The community we built, the connections we made, the things we&rsquo;ve learned, our personal growth, our queer pride, our refugee pride, and achievements: 30 workshop days, 2 published articles, and 4 sharing events!</span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c2">Queer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is a celebration of gender and sexual diversity. It is used as an umbrella term for the wider LGBTQIA+ community, but more importantly queer focuses on inclusion of everyone, particularly the most marginalized within the community. It strives for a more inclusive society and challenges oppressive societal norms: gender/ sexual norms, relationship norms, patriarchal norms, sexist norms, beauty standards etc. Gender/fuck those norms!&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="c8"><span class="c1">We aim to make it </span><span class="c2">safer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;by asking all our guests and ourselves to have intentions to make the space safer. If you share our intentions you are very welcome to celebrate with us, otherwise we&rsquo;ll ask you to leave.</span></p>

      <p class="c8"><span class="c9">Genderclowns Non &amp; Dennis from GenderBendingQueerParty (GBQP) will provide a workshop on queer safer clubbing and holding space. QBQP was a queer safer clubbing night centering queer, trans, nonbinary people and femmes of any gender in Worm Rotterdam. GBQP had its last edition in collaboration with KLAUW in 2022. The workshop is meant for the awareness team (also known as space holders) and everyone else that is interested. Because space holding is a collective effort, in which everyone should take care of each other&#39;s safety and wellbeing.</span></p>

I always wanted to create my own brand but never made it until now. Thanks to LIMBO for giving me this platform in which I can explore my dream and create my art and let it be out there for those who want to explore their queerness and feel more free. We want to give an experience of freedom and at the same time feel empowered by wearing our designs. In this collection Nojan and myself are collaborating together. Nojan is also an Iranian queer dentist/stylist who fled from the war in Ukraine to the Netherlands and is trying to settle here for good. The collection is called </span><span class="c9">Sparkle</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and is especially designed for LIMBO.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">20% of the sales will go to LIMBO as donations to support the other artists/ organizers.</span></p>

      <br>I finished my studies in Hungary and then moved to the Netherlands a year ago.
      <br>I studied theatrical and cinematic design in terms of decoration, costumes and make-up, in addition to my specialization in interior design and painting. In the end, I concluded that all types of arts are connected and indivisible.
      <br>I will share with you some of my paintings at Queer Market in LIMBO that came as a response to the wars that the world is exposed to, and the life that many societies live in, perhaps it will be a small message to bring peace and break the restrictions that surround us and prevent injustice in this world.</span></p>
